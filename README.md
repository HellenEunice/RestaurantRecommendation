## Objetive
- Develop a restaurant recommendation system that suggests top restaurants based on the user's geographical location.

## Used Technology
- `Programming Language:` Python
- `Libraries:` Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Folium, Geopandas
- `Visualization:` Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Express
- `Models:` K Means

## Data
This project utilizes the Yelp Business Public Dataset. The dataset contains various types of businesses in the USA, with a focus on restaurants for this project.

## EDA
The exploratory data analysis provides insights into the top restaurants and highlights cities with the best restaurants. Additionally, there is a map visualizing the geographical distribution of the restaurants in the dataset.

## K means
The project implements a clustering method using K Means based on the top restaurants in Las Vegas. The restaurants are grouped into 5 clusters for better analysis and recommendation.

## Recommendation based on location
The recommendation system functions as follows:
1. **User Input:** Users provide their geographical coordinates (longitude and latitude).
2. **Cluster Assignment:** The system uses K Means clustering to assign the user to a specific cluster based on their location.
3. **Top Restaurant Recommendations:** The system recommends five top-rated restaurants from the cluster assigned to the user.
4. **Map Visualization:** The recommended restaurants are plotted on a map for users to explore visually.
